# cli-twitter
tweet from your shell.

`$ tweet '#twiiter from the #cli is awesome!' `

I like tweeting from the command-line. 
it is a nice to have for bot apps as you do not need to include the actual twitter code, 
just have this tool system-wide. 

## missing features: 
* override credentials with additional arguments
* document
* upload images
* search, follow, retweet
