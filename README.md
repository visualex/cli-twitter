# cli-twitter
tweet from your shell.

`$ tweet '#twiiter from the #cli is awesome!' `

I like tweeting from the command-line, just have this tool system-wide.
Also a nice to have for bot apps.

## missing features: 
* override credentials with additional arguments
* document
* upload images
* search, follow, retweet
